Bankers:
Max,Allocated, Need=Max-Allocated, Available 

Available += Allocated

Safe sequence
Safe state

For finding Need we will use priority.

Description:
1. A project based on optimal and economical distribution of resources for ocean cleanup
2. This project is a real life application of Banker's deadlock avoidance algorithm in operating system
3. In this project I have used the a Variation of Banker's Algorithm to ensure optimal and safe distribution of resources for cleanup of river deltas
4. The variation made was based on a priority score generated using factors such as: population near delta, toxicity of the river, distance from current location of resources
5. In order to find the shortest path to economically transfer the resources via seaways, the concept of A* algo was used.
  

Problems Faced:
1. Deciding the priority formula
2. Deriving an analogy b/w the problem statement and Banker's algorithm
3. Getting the verified data about the exact population at the respective deltas

Soln:
1. priority = (population * toxicity)/distance
2. To get a safe sequence in that will satisfy our requirements efficiently Banker's algo seemed to be the best choice
3. Going through various articles on net about ocean cleanup

Future Work:
1. Handling Dynamic request change
2. The current system is not user friendly (It's just a cpp code for which the user needs to enter data everytime in cmd), making a UI will be effective
3. It's currently more of a theoritical concept that has a scope of exploration in real world
